# Open classroom

In this project, teachers can add additional training courses and students can sign up 
to take them. At the end of the faculty, the teacher evaluates the studentâ€™s work and the results are stored in the archive.
Each training course can be in one of the states:\
ANNOUNCED - the course has been announced and students can enroll in a group;\
WAITING - groups of students have been formed and are awaiting the start of classes;\
LEARNING - the learning process is underway;\
ENDED - the course is completed, grades are being assigned;\
ARCHIVED - learning results are saved in the archive.

Each user can have one of the roles: ADMIN, PROFESSOR, STUDENT.
The application has localization configured for English and Russian.
In the application you can upload images for users.
